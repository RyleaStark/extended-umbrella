  Bringing HomeKit support where there is none. Homebridge allows you to integrate with smart home devices that do not natively support HomeKit.
  There are over 2000 Homebridge plugins supporting thousands of different smart accessories.


  This version of Homebridge for Umbrel adds Intel QuickSync Video to the container, allowing you to utilize hardware video encoding and decoding on compatible x86 Umbrel Devices.
  Your server must have the Intel GPU (QSV) configured at /dev/dri/card0 and /dev/dri/renderD128 for this application to work as expected.
